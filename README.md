## MVP

1. Target Audeience - _Travelers_.  We are targetting the travels to help them plan their trip and heklp them with ideas when they actually get there.  For example plan for what to pack based on weather and where to eat when they get there.

2. Problem addressed.  Consolaiated dashboard for giving you all the things you may need to go to multiple places to get.  This allows the user to go to one place for the things they frequently need when going on a trip.

3. Primary Goal.  Location Dashboard and store favorite travel places.

4. Essential User Stories
   * Create Dashboard HTML Wireframe
     [ ] Figure out how many days of weather to display
     [] Create Header or Jumbotron
     * Create input design for selecting one of saved favorties
     * Create link to switch to page to create a new favorite
     * Mock up what weather data will look like
     * Mocke up what places data will lok like on the page
   * Generate google places API for address, city or zip code
   * Decide whether we want a location map
   * Issue - how should we deal with API Keys - sharing but secure?
