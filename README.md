## MVP

1. Target Audeience - _Travelers_.  We are targetting the travelers to help them plan their trip and help them with ideas when they actually get there.  For example plan for what to pack based on weather and where to eat when they get there.

2. Problem addressed.  Travels needing to go to multiple websites to get the information they want to research their travel destination. Our app resolves this with a consolidated dashboard for giving you all the things you may need to go to multiple places to get.  This allows the user to go to one place for the things they frequently need when going on a trip.

3. Primary Goal.  Location Dashboard with weather and places with ability to store favorite travel destinations for quick lookup.

4. Essential User Stories (see projet dashboards)
   * Create Dashboard HTML Wireframe
   * Create API for places
   * Create API for weather
   * Create Model for firebase storing favorites
